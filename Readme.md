## BookIt — Experiences & Slots (simple docs)

This repository contains a demo-ready experiences & slots booking app (originally a car rental starter) with a React frontend and an Express + MongoDB backend.

This README gives a concise guide to run the app in development, explains the demo/offline behavior, and points to the important files.

### Quick overview
- Frontend: client/ (Vite + React, Tailwind)
- Backend: Server/ (Express, Mongoose)
- Demo data: `client/src/assets/assets.js` — used when backend is unreachable

----

## Run locally (dev)

1) Install dependencies for both projects:

```powershell
# from repo root
cd client; npm install; cd ..
cd Server; npm install; cd ..
```

2) Start backend:

```powershell
# from Server folder
npm run dev
# or: npm start
```

3) Start frontend:

```powershell
# from client folder
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The frontend tries to use an environment variable `VITE_BACKEND_URL`. If it's not set it falls back to `http://localhost:5000` (the repo includes defensive fallbacks). If the backend is not running, the frontend will use bundled demo data and simulate bookings.

----

## Demo / offline behavior

- The app bundles demo experiences in `client/src/assets/assets.js`. When the backend is not reachable, the UI falls back to that data so you can browse experiences and simulate bookings without a server.
- The checkout flow attempts to POST to the backend when available. On network errors it will simulate a booking locally and show a confirmation (this keeps the demo flow smooth).

----

## Important files

- `client/src/` — React app source (pages, components, context)
- `client/src/assets/assets.js` — bundled demo experiences and availability data
- `client/src/context/AppContext.jsx` — central app state (axios baseURL, experiences fallback)
- `Server/Server.js` — backend entry point and route registration
- `Server/Controllers/bookingController.js` — booking handler (demo-tolerant)
- `Server/Config/db.js` — DB connection helper (note: currently exits process on DB connect failure; change if you want server to start without DB)

----

## Quick dev tips

- If you don't have a MongoDB instance handy and want the server to start even when DB is unavailable, we can change `Server/Config/db.js` so it logs the error instead of calling `process.exit(1)`.
- To remove old build output and reduce repo size, `client/dist/` can be safely deleted; it's generated by the frontend build.

----

## Next steps / TODOs

- (Optional) Remove build artifacts (`client/dist/`) to keep repository small.
- (Optional) If you want to permanently remove authentication, I can remove JWT-related code and the packages from the server.
- Re-introduce capacity/availability checks on the server once your real DB uses ObjectIds (demo mode uses string IDs and the simplified booking controller avoids CastErrors).
